## Project Description

The dataset for this project consists of labeled data with following features. The target column is called 'Personal Loan' which is used to predict whether a customer gets approved for loan or not.

Outcome of this Project : This project tells us, whether a student will get student loan during coronavirus economic crisis from UGC, based on some criteria.

Feature of this Project : After completing the registration, client will get confirmation message and email. If a student apply for a loan and providing criteria

           	  Firstname
	          Lastname
	          Dependants
	          ApplicantIncome
	          CoapplicantIncome
	          LoanAmount
	          Loan_Amount_Term
	          Credit_History

	          Married
	          Education
	          Self_Employed
           	  Property_Area
then will get confirmation message and email which tells whether a student will get student loan
